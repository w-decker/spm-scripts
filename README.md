# spm-scripts
This repository contains code used to preprocess fMRI data using [Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).

## FYI
`fmriunzip.m` and `glob.m` and a few forthcoming scripts/functions are not pertinent to any level of analysis but provide a cleaner script for parseing files.
